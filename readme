So Hi guys go was new to me as this is the first time I have worked on go but its intersting due to its efficiency .

-------USING THE APP------
To test the API using Postman or cURL:

Make a POST request to http://localhost:8080/intersections.
Add the header Authorization: YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN to the request.
Include the GeoJSON linestring with 5k points in the request body.
Send the request and observe the response.
